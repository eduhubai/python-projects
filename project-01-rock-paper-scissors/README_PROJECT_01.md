# Project 01: Rock-Paper-Scissors

Welcome to Project 01: Rock-Paper-Scissors! This is a beginner-friendly Python project aimed at teaching the basics of programming through a fun, interactive game. In this game, you'll compete against the computer in a classic match of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

## Getting Started

This section provides instructions on how to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project is compatible with Python 3.x versions. If you need to install Python, visit the official website:

[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-projects.git

2. Navigate to the `project-01-rock-paper-scissors` directory:

```bash
cd python-projects/project-01-rock-paper-scissors

```

3. No additional setup is required. The project can be run directly with Python.

## Running the Game

To run the game, execute the following command in the terminal while in the project directory:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to play against the computer. You will be asked to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the game will tell you if you've won, lost, or tied with the computer.

## How It Works

This section explains the core concepts used in the game's development, such as loops for continuous play, conditionals for game logic, and the `random` library for generating the computer's choices.

## Contributing
